# picoCTF WriteUps

picoCTF is a platform to learn, solve cyber security related challenges 
We will see Forensics(Medium) challenges

# Medium

## Disko-2
![](/assets/images/Disko-2.png)
This is an advanced version of Disko-1 challenge
We got a `dd` img
First all of we need to unzip it using `gunzip`
```shell
gunzip disko-2.dd.gz
```

Search for strings in that img 
```shell
strings disko-2.dd
```
Didn't get the one we need
So, now we are using Sleuthkit to examine the dd img
Using mmls to get the layout of the disk img
```shell
mmls disko-2.dd
```
```shell
dd if=disko-2.dd  of=Linuxdisko.img skip=2048 count=51200  
```
`dd` is a low-level Unix/Linux utility used to copy and convert raw data, often used for imaging disks or partitions.
if = Input File, of = Output File, skip =  skip the bytes from the start, count = Maximum length of dd file written into Outputfile
Now, we got the img file, Perform some operations like string operations, img analysis on it
```shell 
strings Linuxdisko.img | grep picoCTF
```
Got the flag 
Flag : `picoCTF{4_P4Rt_1t_i5_a93c3ba0}`

## Disko-3
![](/assets/images/Disko-3.png)
This is an advanced version of Disko-1 & Disko-2 challenge
We got a `dd` img
First all of we need to unzip it using `gunzip`
```shell
gunzip disko-3.dd.gz
```

Search for strings in that img 
```shell
strings disko-3.dd
```
Didn't get the one we need
So, now we are using Sleuthkit to examine the dd img
Using mmls to get the layout of the disk img
```shell
mmls disko-3.dd
```

```shell
fls -r -p disko-3.dd
```
Check for flag or something related terms
And you we found flag.gz
Save that file
Icat is used to write out a file  
```shell
icat disko-3.dd 522628 > flag.gz 
```
now unzip `flag.gz` file
```shell
gunzip flag.gz
```
Try to find the Strings in it 
```shell
strings flag | grep picoCTF
```
Got the flag
Flag : `picoCTF{n3v3r_z1p_2_h1d3_7e0a17da}`

## Flags are Stepic
![](/assets/images/FAS.png)
It is about flags, We need to find the flag which odd one among all of the Flags
These flags are country flags, so we need to find the country's flag which is created or edited
You have to start the instance and view the page source of the web page
Observe all the flags, You will find a flag styled with *css*

`{ name:  "Upanzi, Republic The",img: "flags/upz.png", style:"width: 120px!important; height: 90px!important;" } `

This flag of Upanzi is interesting, installing the flag image for analysis
The challenge is named as stepic hence we are using stepic 
*Stepic* is used to encode a string in a png file and extract text from the png file
```shell
stepic -d -l upz.png
```

## Event_viewing
![](/assets/images/EV.png)
We have got Windows log file, it's a raw text we need to find some base64, normal, or binary or anything else

```shell
evtx_dump.py Windowslog.evtx > log.xml
```
We have converted evtx file into xml file, analyze it better
Search for base64 encoded strings 
```shell
strings log.xml | grep == =
```
Got some base64 encoded strings, now we need to decode them
Using echo, you can use cyberchef website also to do such activities. 
Link: [CyberChef](www.cyberchef.com)
```shell
echo "cGljb0NURntFdjNudF92aTN3djNyXw==" | base64 -d
echo "MXNfYV9wcjN0dHlfdXMzZnVsXw==" | base64 -d
echo "dDAwbF84MWJhM2ZlOX0=" | base64 -d
```
Got the flag
Flag : `picoCTF{Ev3nt_vi3wv3r_1s_a_pr3tty_us3ful_t00l_81ba3fe9}`

## Mob Psycho
![](/assets/images/Mob_Psycho.png)
This is an apk file, we need to *unzip* it.
Try to find any file named with flag
```shell
find | grep 

Got the Flag
Flag : `picoCTF{ax8mC0RU6ve_NX85l4ax8mCl_85dbd215}`
