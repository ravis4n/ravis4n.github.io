# Easy

## Disko-1

![Disko](/assets/images/Disko1.png)

We got a challenge called Disko-1. It's a compressed zip file, so I decompressed it to move forward

```shell
gunzip disko1.dd.gz
```

Well, got the decompressed one searching for strings
```shell
    strings disko1.dd | grep picoCTF
```

Got the flag
Flag: picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_be6031da}

## RED
![Red](/assets/images/RED.png)
Got the challenge named RED, it's a png file
We can use cyberchef RGBA values to get the flag, either zsteg 
```shell
zsteg red.png 
```
You can see a base64 encoded string copy it and do the next step

```shell
echo "cGljb0NURntyM2RfMXNfdGgzX3VsdDFtNHQzX2N1cjNfZjByXzU0ZG4zNTVffQ==" | base64 -d
```
Got the flag
Flag: picoCTF{r3d_1s_th3_ult1m4t3_cur3_f0r_54dn355_}    

## Ph4nt0m 1ntrud3r

## Scan Surprise
![SS](/assets/images/Scan_Surprise.png)
Scan surprise, in the name we got the hint like scanning something
Start the instance 
You get a QR code, you can scan it and get the flag

## Secret of the polyglot
![SOTP](/assets/images/Secret%20of%20the%20Polyglot.png)
So, we got a pdf file and it already have the last half of the flag
![](/assets/images/sotp-last-half.png)
Now, we need to find the first half of the flag
```shell
mv flag2topdf.pdf flag2topdf.png
```
We converted pdf file into image, by opening the image we can get the first half of the flag

Got the flag

## CanYouSee
![](/assets/images/CanYouSee.png)
Download the zip
Unzip it using 
```shell
unzip unknown.zip
```
now you got the jpg file, examine the image with tools
```shell
exiftool ukn_reality.jpg
```
You gotthe base64 encoded string, we need to decode it
```shell
echo "cGljb0NURntNRTc0RDQ3QV9ISUREM05fM2I5MjA5YTJ9Cg==" | base64 -d
```
Got the flag
Flag : picoCTF{ME74D47A_HIDD3N_3b9209a2}


## Information
![Info](/assets/images/Information.png)
Got a cat image, there might be a flag in Information of image as the challenge name is Information
Using image analysis tools to check whether we can find any flag
![info](/assets/images/Information-exiftool.png)

Got a base64 encoded text here in the image, now we need to convert it into normal text 
```shell
echo "cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9==" | base64 -d
```
Got the flag
Flag: picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}

## Glory of the Garden
![Garden](/assets/images/garden.jpg)
This garden image may contains hidden text in it, let's try to extract it using 
```shell
strings garden.jpg | grep picoCTF
```
Got the flag
Flag : picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}
