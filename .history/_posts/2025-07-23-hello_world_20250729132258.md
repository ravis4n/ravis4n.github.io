We got a challenge called Disko-1. It's a compressed zip file, so I decompressed it to move forward
```shell
gunzip disko1.dd.gz

Well, got the decompressed one searching for strings
```shell
strings disko1.dd | grep picoCTF

got the flag

<p>
Got the challenge named RED, it's a png file
We can use cyberchef 
</p>
```shell
zsteg red.png 

You can see a base64 encoded string copy it and do the next step

```shell
echo "cGljb0NURntyM2RfMXNfdGgzX3VsdDFtNHQzX2N1cjNfZjByXzU0ZG4zNTVffQ==" | base64 -d
