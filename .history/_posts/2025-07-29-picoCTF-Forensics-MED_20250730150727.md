## Disko-2
![](/assets/images/Disko-2.png)
This is an advanced version of Disko-1 challenge
We got a `dd` img
First all of we need to unzip it using `gunzip`
```shell
gunzip disko-2.dd.gz
```

Search for strings in that img 
```shell
strings disko-2.dd
```
Didn't get the one we need
So, now we are using Sleuthkit to examine the dd img
Using mmls to get the layout of the disk img
```shell
mmls disko-2.dd
```
```shell
dd if=disko-2.dd  of=Linuxdisko.img skip=2048 count=51200  
```
`dd` is a low-level Unix/Linux utility used to copy and convert raw data, often used for imaging disks or partitions.
if = Input File, of = Output File, skip =  skip the bytes from the start, count = Maximum len
