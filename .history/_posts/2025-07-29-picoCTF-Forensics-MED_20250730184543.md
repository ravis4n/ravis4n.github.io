# picoCTF WriteUps

picoCTF is a platform to learn, solve cyber security related challenges 
We will see Forensics(Medium) challenges

![picoCTF](/assets/images/picoCTF.jpg)

# Medium

## Disko-2
![](/assets/images/Disko-2.png)
This is an advanced version of Disko-1 challenge
We got a `dd` img
First all of we need to unzip it using `gunzip`
```shell
gunzip disko-2.dd.gz
```

Search for strings in that img 
```shell
strings disko-2.dd
```
Didn't get the one we need
So, now we are using Sleuthkit to examine the dd img
Using mmls to get the layout of the disk img
```shell
mmls disko-2.dd
```
```shell
dd if=disko-2.dd  of=Linuxdisko.img skip=2048 count=51200  
```
`dd` is a low-level Unix/Linux utility used to copy and convert raw data, often used for imaging disks or partitions.
if = Input File, of = Output File, skip =  skip the bytes from the start, count = Maximum length of dd file written into Outputfile
Now, we got the img file, Perform some operations like string operations, img analysis on it
```shell 
strings Linuxdisko.img | grep picoCTF
```
Got the flag 
Flag : `picoCTF{4_P4Rt_1t_i5_a93c3ba0}`

## Disko-3
![](/assets/images/Disko-3.png)
This is an advanced version of Disko-1 & Disko-2 challenge
We got a `dd` img
First all of we need to unzip it using `gunzip`
```shell
gunzip disko-3.dd.gz
```

Search for strings in that img 
```shell
strings disko-3.dd
```
Didn't get the one we need
So, now we are using Sleuth-kit to examine the dd img
Using mmls to get the layout of the disk img
```shell
mmls disko-3.dd
```

```shell
fls -r -p disko-3.dd
```
Check for flag or something related terms
And you we found flag.gz
Save that file
Icat is used to write out a file  
```shell
icat disko-3.dd 522628 > flag.gz 
```
now unzip `flag.gz` file
```shell
gunzip flag.gz
```
Try to find the Strings in it 
```shell
strings flag | grep picoCTF
```
Got the flag
Flag : `picoCTF{n3v3r_z1p_2_h1d3_7e0a17da}`

## Flags are Stepic
![](/assets/images/FAS.png)
It is about flags, We need to find the flag which odd one among all of the Flags
These flags are country flags, so we need to find the country's flag which is created or edited
You have to start the instance and view the page source of the web page
Observe all the flags, You will find a flag styled with *css*

`{ name:  "Upanzi, Republic The",img: "flags/upz.png", style:"width: 120px!important; height: 90px!important;" } `

This flag of Upanzi is interesting, installing the flag image for analysis
The challenge is named as stepic hence we are using stepic 
*Stepic* is used to encode a string in a png file and extract text from the png file
```shell
stepic -d -l upz.png
```

## Event_viewing
![](/assets/images/EV.png)
We have got Windows log file, it's a raw text we need to find some base64, normal, or binary or anything else

```shell
evtx_dump.py Windowslog.evtx > log.xml
```
We have converted evtx file into xml file, analyze it better
Search for base64 encoded strings 
```shell
strings log.xml | grep == =
```
Got some base64 encoded strings, now we need to decode them
Using echo, you can use cyberchef website also to do such activities. 
Link: [CyberChef](www.cyberchef.com)
```shell
echo "cGljb0NURntFdjNudF92aTN3djNyXw==" | base64 -d
echo "MXNfYV9wcjN0dHlfdXMzZnVsXw==" | base64 -d
echo "dDAwbF84MWJhM2ZlOX0=" | base64 -d
```
Got the flag
Flag : `picoCTF{Ev3nt_vi3wv3r_1s_a_pr3tty_us3ful_t00l_81ba3fe9}`

## Mob Psycho
![](/assets/images/Mob_Psycho.png)
This is an apk file, we need to *unzip* it.
Try to find any file named with flag or pico
```shell
find | grep flag
find | grep pico
```
It has given the file with the path 
Search for strings in the *flag.txt* file
```shell
strings flag.txt
```
Got a hexadecimal string here now
```shell
echo "7069636f4354467b6178386d433052553676655f4e5838356c346178386d436c5f38356462643231357d" | xxd -r -p
```
Got the Flag
Flag : `picoCTF{ax8mC0RU6ve_NX85l4ax8mCl_85dbd215}`

## Pcap Poisoning
![](/assets/images/PP.png)

We have given a challenge called Pcap Poisioning, may be an infected wireshark 
open the file in wireshark
check the packets of TCP & UDP and look for *pico*
Got the flag 
Flag : `picoCTF{P64P_4N4L7S1S_SU55355FUL_5b6a6061}`

## Dear Diary
We have given a disk img, which usually contains details
We should go through all possible partitions while searching for the flag
Using *Autopsy* to solve this disk img 
Flag : `picoCTF{1_533_n4m35_80d24b30}`

## Torrent analyzer


## St3g0
![](/assets/images/stego.png)
We have given an image here 
Performing image analysis using zsteg, steghide, exiftool, binwalk,etc
I will go with zsteg 
```shell
zsteg pico.flag.png
```
Got the flag
Flag : `picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_a9a181eb}`

## Sleuthkit Intro
![](/assets/images/sk_int.png)
Sleuthkit is a digital forensics toolkit used to investigate disk images, file systems, and recover deleted files. It's widely used by forensic analysts, law enforcement, and cybersecurity professionals for digital investigations

Unzip the disk img using *gunzip*
```shell
gunzip disk.flag.img
```
Using mmls for the layout of partitions of the disk
![](/assets/images/mmls.png)
You can see the length of Linux partition.
Run the instance and enter the length.
![](/assets/images/nc_sk.png)
Flag : `picoCTF{mm15_f7w!}`


## Sleuth-kit Apprentice
![](/assets/images/SA.png)
We have got another challenge related to Sleuth-kit called Sleuth-kit Apprentice
download the disk img and unzip it using *gunzip*
```shell
gunzip disk.flag.img.gz
```
mmls helps us by showing the layout of the disk
```shell
mmls disk.flag.img
```
```shell
fls -o 2048 disk.flag.img -r -p
fls -o 206848 disk.flag.img -r -p
fls -o 360448 disk.flag.img -r -p
```
Check all of them

```shell 
Got the flag
Flag : `picoCTF{by73_5urf3r_adac6cb4}`
